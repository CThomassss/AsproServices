# PHP Admin for AS-PRO-SERVICE

Steps to use the PHP admin:

1. Copy `config.example.php` to `config.php` and fill your database credentials (or leave empty to use `data/promotions.json`).
2. Ensure `public/promotions/` is writable by the webserver.
3. If you use MySQL, import `sql/init_users.sql` to create a `users` table, or run the `scripts/generate-superadmin.js` locally and insert the produced SQL in your DB.
	- To create the `promotions` table, import `sql/create_promotions.sql` (new file created in the `sql/` folder).
4. Upload the `php-admin/` folder and the `out/` static site generated by `npm run export` to your hosting (e.g. put `out/` content in `public_html/` and `php-admin/` in `public_html/admin/`).
5. Open `/admin/login.php` and connect.

Notes:
- Do NOT commit `config.php` containing real credentials to your repository.
- For simple hosting, you can use JSON file storage (no DB) by leaving DB values empty and editing `PROMOTIONS_JSON` path in `config.php` if needed.
